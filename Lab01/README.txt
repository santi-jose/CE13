File Version Differences:
Lines 14 and 15 from the original file were deleted, leaving only
line 13 as the singular blank line between the comment on line 
12 and the beginning of main(). Unnecessary blank spaces deleted
for readability

Line 19 in the original file, line 17 in the current, had blank
space deleted after the first bracket and blank space deleted
before the right-most bracket. Deleted in order to show clearly
what is within the brackets.

The bracket,in line 25, following the for loop in line 24 of the 
original file was moved to be on the same line as the for loop in
the current file, line 22. This helps any readers see what is within
the for loop more clearly and immediately. 

Line 32 in the original file had an extra tab before the valsToBeStored
array. Unnecessary spaces were also deleted, but there were spaces
added within the array brackets [] to make the distinction of the 
operation (+) more obvious to readers. 

Line 35 from the original file, 34 in the current, had spaces added
after semicolons, as well as before and after operations(+/>) for
clarity.

4. Hello world was pretty easy for me since i have prior c programming
experience. I think breakpoints will be very useful going forward because
they can help you identify bugs much quicker.
