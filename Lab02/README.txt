When I ran scanf(" ") in my main provided it didn't allow for any of the other 
code to run. My serial terminal wouldn't take any input.

A rule like having a designated area for printf and scanf is useful because
it organizes your code neatly. Compartmentalizing code like this makes it 
more readable.

I worked on this lab for about 16 hours. It took a while and I still don't have it 
right. As of now I can't determine valid from invalid operands. I'll work on it for
as long as I can.
