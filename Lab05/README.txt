In this lab we worked with pointers to implement a doubly linked list. We used
the pointers as ways to store lists more efficiently than the array. This data
type is connected via pointers. We had to deal with the pointers to influence
the linked list. We just learned how to make the linked list. The most important
part of the lab were the pointers. It can be tricky to recoognize how to use them
but once you do they are pretty useful. Another important part of this lab was
making sure to check all edge cases. There were many instances when a pointer
could be null and the functions would have to be able to deal with thenm appropriately.

My approach to the lab was to read the lab manual first. I always read the lab 
manual first because I like having an idea of what to expect for the actual
lab work. I think that's the most important thing, familiarizing yourself with
the topic beforehand. The biggest problem I had with this lab was figuring out 
those tricky edge cases. Especially since you can't ask for the next or previous
item if given a null pointer. So I had to make sure I was checking for those
null pointers, as well as the head and tail of the list. Another tricky part was
doing the sort function. I was trying to get it but I feel really lost about it.
I would work with more people more often if I were to redo this lab. It is really 
beneficial to talk and listen to people when you have a question. 

I think I did pretty well on the lab despite missing the whole sorting algorithm
file. I didn't get to this part of the lab due to just not having time to get help. 
I'm trying to start earlier and work with more people to alleviate this struggle.
My Summer session one class ended so I'm hoping to dedicate more time to this one.
I liked linkedlist because they seem really handy. After implementing the 
functions myself I think they're pretty useful to store data. Would've been nice
to get ti the rest of the lab. Overall I'm satisfied with my work. I think i got
the general information I needed out of it.
