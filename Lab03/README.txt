In this lab we used multidimensional arrays to write functions that performed
matrix operations. I believe the purpose of this lab was to teach us arrays and
passing by reference. Not only that but I think it served as practice for building
test harnesses. My approach to the lab was just to read the manual and then 
write whatever I could. Then I would go to lab and try to get help. If i could go
back I would start the lab earlier and I'd ask the question about how to make 
the submatrix function. This function had me very confused so I wasn't able to finish.
I worked for like 12 hours on this lab. This lab was ok for learning to code. 
It is repetitive so it's not too hard. The only thing is the ambiguity of the
information provided for the submatrix function.
