    In this lab we began programming our uno32. We learned to code our inputs
out to the physical hardware with bit masks. We programmed our switches, LEDs,
adc, and buttons. I believe one of the most important takeaways from this lab is
to understand states and events in our finite state machines and event driven 
programs.

To start this lab I just dove into the code and read the manual along the way.
It was a little confusing but I started earlier to give myself some more time 
to think. It was useful I feel like for my retention, but it took longer
to get certain things if I had just read the manual. 

The final product was pretty satisfying. It was cool to see how the hardware 
and the code were communicating on a macroscopic level. The only thing  I didn't
like was the confusion with the Buttons.c file. The ButtonCheckEvents function
was also really vague.
